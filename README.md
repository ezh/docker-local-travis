# local-travis Docker image

Ten thousand thanks to Fergal Hainey!

**Ignore all of this. travis-build doesn’t work the way I thought it
did, it will actually just run the commands from your first ever build.
I haven’t figured out a way of doing what I actually want instead yet.**

The `ferhai/local-travis` Docker image is useful for running your Travis
builds against your local version before pushing. This way if you want
to do local testing, you don’t need to keep a separate way of making and
invoking your build in sync with Travis.

## Quick start

Docker is required. The following command assumes a fairly standard
docker installation:

`docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(pwd):/project local-travis`

This will run the builds defined in the `.travis.yml` in your current
directory.

## How it works

The command running in the docker image uses Travis Ci’s open-source
[travis-build](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build) to make
build scripts from the `.travis.yml` file. Each build script is modified
so that it works against the local copy instead of making a new clone of
the repository, and then run on one of Travis CI’s Docker images for the
language specified in the `.travis.yml` file.

The Docker socket must be mounted so that the container can make use of
the host’s Docker. The current directory containing the `.travis.yml`
file must be mounted as `/project`.

## Options

By default only the first 10 builds in Travis CI’s “matrix” will be run,
to prevent massively parallel builds taking too long as they are run in
serial locally. This can be changed by passing the
`LOCAL_TRAVIS_MAX_BUILDS` environment variable to the container.
